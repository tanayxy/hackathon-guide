    fullDescription: "This project focuses on building a robust content moderation system that can automatically identify harmful, offensive, or inappropriate text content. The system will use advanced NLP techniques to detect various categories of problematic content including hate speech, harassment, threats, explicit content, and misinformation. It will work across multiple languages and be designed to understand context and evolving language patterns. The solution will include configurable severity levels, human review workflows for edge cases, and continuous learning from user feedback to improve accuracy over time.",
